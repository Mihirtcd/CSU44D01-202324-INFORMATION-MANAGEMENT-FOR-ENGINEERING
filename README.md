## Project Overview
This project, developed for the course **CSU44D01-202324 INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR ENGINEERING** at Trinity College Dublin, focuses on creating an Online Food Ordering System for a Restaurant. The project showcases an ER model implementation as a MySQL database, covering critical aspects of database design, normalization, and SQL operations.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Designing a robust database structure for an Online Food Ordering System.
- Implementing and managing data using MySQL.
- Ensuring data integrity and security through effective database management techniques.

### 🗂️ Key Entities
- `Menu_Item`: Stores each dish/item details on the menu.
- `Customer`: Manages customer details like ID, name, contact info, and address.
- `Orders`: Tracks order details including items ordered and total cost.
- `Bill`: Handles billing details, including amount and payment status.
- `Payment_Detail`: Records payment transactions associated with orders.

### 📊 ER Model & Relational Schema
